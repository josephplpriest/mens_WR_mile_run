# Data Cleaning and Visualization  ---  Men's World Record Mile Run Times

This project was created by Paul Priest for Code Louisville Data Analytics w/Python Part 1 students.

## Goals:

1. Develop confidence with looking up and using documentation.

2. Become familiar with pandas methods, as it is by far the most commonly used python library for data analysis.

3. Arrange questions with a range of difficulties, to help ease students into doing more coding.

4. Clean some data (strings, numerics and dates).

5. Do some simple aggregations (group by, unique values).

6. Do one visualization with the cleaned data.
